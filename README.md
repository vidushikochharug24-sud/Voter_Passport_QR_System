## Alpha-bots – Voter Passport QR System
-> Project Overview
Voter Passport QR System is a hackathon project aimed at enabling seamless inter-state voter registration updates using a QR-based Voter Passport.
The system is designed to ensure one active voter registration per citizen, prevent duplication across states, and improve voter accessibility through a simple, tech-driven interface.

## My contribution:
-Developed the Frontend: Built a responsive interface using React.js, JavaScript, and CSS.
-Enabled Voter Mobility: Designed the system to support inter-state voter mobility, helping to reduce administrative duplication.
-Created QR Workflows: Implemented user-friendly workflows for voter verification and status updates via QR codes.
-Improved Efficiency: Focused on enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of voter data handling through the digital interface.
-Simplified UI for Diverse Groups: Designed an intuitive UI specifically aimed at making interactions simple for a wide range of user groups.
